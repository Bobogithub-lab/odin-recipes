        <h1>Vidalia Onion Pie</h1>
        <img src="./onion_pie.jpg" alt="onion pie image">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h4>A light dinner of Vidalia onion pie, a nice salad on the side, and a ice cold glass of homemade lemonade is perfect for hot summer nights! Optional additions can be sweet red pepper to the onions as they cook and/or crumbled bacon or fresh ham bits may be added to the mixture prior to baking. All versions are great! If desired, a couple Vidalia onion rings look great on the top of the pie for decoration!</h4>
